DESCRIPTION 
A book review app that assists users in finding new reads through the aid of other peer's ratings and reviews. After signing up, users have access to a large digital library allowing them to view information regarding a book's information such as the author, release date and synopsis. Users also have the option to customise their own profiles to distinguish themselves from other reviewers, as well as leave their own ratings and reviews.
